## Instructions ( git clone )
- ## Fork this repository
<!-- TODO: fix later -->
!()C:\Users\User\Desktop\2022-03-31 21_15_35-Window.png
This will make a copy of this repository in your github account (takes a couple of seconds)

- ## Clone the repository
  - Once you have this repository in your github account, you need to get the link here ...
<!-- TODO: fix later -->

  - Then you need to copy that link in your git bash (or CLI of preference) `git clone "the link you got"`

**Example**

`git clone https://github.com/Hachikoi-the-creator/`


- ## Create a new branch
  - You need to make this in order to be able to commit changes, and then I need to verify those changes ( that's how OS works ðŸŽ‰ )
  - Get into the project folder ( if you are not there already )
  - Use `git checkout -b myBranch` where 'myBranch' is any name you want to use for your branch

  - Add your user name, and social networks inside `Constributors.md` in the same format as the example
  - **if you are feeling adventurous, I have code challeges in the .js file (leave a comment whit your username inside the function you created!)ðŸ˜Ž**

- ## Commit the changes
  - First you need to write `git add .` the dot means, everything
  - then you need to commit `git commit -m "my message"`, where 'my message' is any message you want to put
  - After that, push the changes to your github account `git push myBranch`
